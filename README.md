# Multiclass-classification-using-logistics-regression-Part-2-neural-network
In the previous part, we implemented multi-class logistic regression to recognize handwritten digits. However, logistic regression cannot form more complex hypotheses as it is only a linear classifier.In this part, we will implement a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the same training set as before. The neural network will be able to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. For this, we will be using parameters from a neural network that we have already trained. Our goal is to implement the feedforward propagation algorithm to use our weights for prediction.
It has 3 layers – an input layer, a hidden layer and an output layer. Recall that our inputs are pixel values of digit images. Since the images are of size 20×20, this gives us 400 input layer units (excluding the extra bias unit which always outputs +1).
